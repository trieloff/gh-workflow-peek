# Publishing Guide

This guide explains how to publish `gh-workflow-peek` as a GitHub CLI extension.

## Pre-Publishing Checklist

1. [ ] Replace all `<OWNER>` placeholders with your GitHub username/organization:
   - `README.md`
   - `gh-workflow-peek` (script header and help text)
   - `CHANGELOG.md`
   
2. [ ] Replace `<YOUR NAME>` in `LICENSE` with your actual name

3. [ ] Test the extension locally:
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   ./tests/test-simple.sh
   
   # Test with shellcheck
   shellcheck gh-workflow-peek
   ```

4. [ ] Ensure all dependencies are documented in README

## Publishing Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Create a new repository named `gh-workflow-peek` on GitHub
2. Make sure the repository is public

### 2. Push Code

```bash
# Initialize git if not already done
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit of gh-workflow-peek extension"

# Add remote (replace <OWNER> with your username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/<OWNER>/gh-workflow-peek.git

# Push to main branch
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Set Up GitHub Actions (Optional)

Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` for automated testing:

```yaml
name: Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y jq shellcheck
    
    - name: Run shellcheck
      run: shellcheck gh-workflow-peek
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: ./tests/test-simple.sh

  test-multi-platform:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Install dependencies (Ubuntu)
      if: matrix.os == 'ubuntu-latest'
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y jq
    
    - name: Install dependencies (macOS)
      if: matrix.os == 'macos-latest'
      run: |
        brew install jq
    
    - name: Test script structure
      run: |
        # Basic structural tests that don't require gh auth
        head -n 1 gh-workflow-peek | grep -q "#!/usr/bin/env bash"
        grep -q "VERSION=" gh-workflow-peek
        grep -q "check_dependencies" gh-workflow-peek
```

Create `.github/workflows/release.yml` for automated releases:

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y jq shellcheck
          ./tests/test-simple.sh
      
      - name: Create Release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
          body: |
            Release ${{ github.ref }}
            
            ## Installation
            ```bash
            gh extension install ${{ github.repository }}
            ```
            
            ## What's Changed

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Found

If users report "extension not found" errors:
1. Ensure repository is public
2. Check repository name matches exactly `gh-workflow-peek`
